This assignment was assigned by the Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive Precourse Program.
In this assignment I created a mock social networking single-page application imitating the popular website Twitter.

I implement features such as:
- A user feed
- An "Update Feed" button to refresh and display new items in reverse chronological order
- A Friends List side bar
- A "User Feed" feature to render items posted by specific users
  - By clicking on a username on a feed item or the username on the Friends list you can view the user's personal feed
- Timestamps based on how long ago the post was created in relation to the current time
